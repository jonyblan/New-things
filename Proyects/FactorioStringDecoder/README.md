# This is the code I used to encode and decode factorio strings
### this can also go from ASM to factorio string using the blueprint download in [reddit link]

The instructions (after having copied de bp) are:
1) Create your ASM file in /asm/code.asm using the format required [TODO make a format file]
2) Excecute python readAsm.py
3) Navigate to /encode and excecute encoder.py
4) Copy the output and paste it inside factorio's string decoder
5) Paste the blueprint in [put where]
6) Press the button [put which button]
7) Done! Your assembler program is oficially running inside factorio

Please remember to read the file regarding the format of the assembler file, I'll try to make it able to completely encode a real asm file but at the moment it's not able to (but almost anything you want to do you can do it if you follow the rules)
