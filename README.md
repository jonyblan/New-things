# New-things
A repository to learn new languages and technologies

3 main folders:
- Languages: Small proyects to get familiarized with how the language works and its syntax. You could think it as "oh I have to code something in ... but I haven't touched the language for 2 years, lets see its folder". And then you'd have a nice wrap up of the language
- Technologies: Small/medium proyects to get familiarized with a library/technology and how to use it. It's mostly separated by language and serves the same purpose as languages
- Proyects: medium/large proyects. It contains a culmination of different languages and technologies coming together to serve one purpose and represents my understanding in certain topics (for example I plan to create an AI of some sort and it'd be here)
