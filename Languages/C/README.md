Summary:
C is an optimal choice for projects requiring low-level control, efficiency, and direct access to hardware resources. It is well-suited for systems programming, embedded systems development, and applications with stringent performance requirements. The language's portability and ability to produce efficient and concise code make it a foundational choice for building robust and high-performance software.

Setup:
- Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC for Linux, MinGW for Windows).

Execution:
1) Open a text editor and paste the C code into a new file with a .c extension (e.g., program.c).
2) Open a terminal or command prompt.
3) Navigate to the directory containing your C file.
4) Compile the program by running: gcc program.c -o program (replace gcc with the appropriate compiler if needed).
5) Execute the compiled program with: ./program (on Linux/macOS) or program.exe (on Windows).

Why/how is it used:
- Systems Programming: C is widely used for developing operating systems, device drivers, and other system-level software.
- Embedded Systems: C is the preferred language for programming embedded systems and microcontrollers due to its low-level control.
- Performance-Critical Applications: C is chosen for applications where performance and memory efficiency are crucial, such as real-time systems.

Strengths:
- Low-Level Control: C provides low-level access to memory and hardware, giving developers precise control over system resources.
- Portability: C code can be highly portable across different platforms with minimal modification.
- Efficiency: C is known for its efficiency in terms of both execution speed and memory usage.
