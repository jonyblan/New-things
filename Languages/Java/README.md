Summary:
Java excels in building platform-independent enterprise-level applications, web development using frameworks like Spring, and Android mobile app development. Its write-once-run-anywhere philosophy, extensive ecosystem, and scalability make it a reliable choice for large-scale projects.

Setup:
- Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

Execution:
1) Open a text editor and paste the Java code into a new file with a .java extension (e.g., Main.java).
2) Open a terminal or command prompt.
3) Navigate to the directory containing your Java file.
4) Compile the program by running: javac Main.java.
5) Execute the compiled program with: java Main.

Why/how is it used:
- Enterprise Applications: Java is widely used for building large-scale enterprise applications, including customer relationship management (CRM) systems.
- Web Development: Java, especially with frameworks like Spring, is popular for building web applications.
- Mobile Development: Java is used for Android app development.

Strengths:
- Platform Independence: Java applications can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), providing platform independence.
- Large Ecosystem: Java has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it suitable for various application domains.
