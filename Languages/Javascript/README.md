Summary:
JavaScript is essential for web development, offering dynamic and interactive front-end experiences. It is equally relevant on the server side with Node.js, making it versatile for full-stack development. JavaScript's ubiquity and support in cross-platform mobile frameworks like React Native also make it suitable for diverse project requirements.

Setup:
- Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

Execution:
1) Open a text editor and paste the JavaScript code into a new file with a .js extension (e.g., program.js).
