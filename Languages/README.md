(most) Folders will be divided in:

basics file:
- will contain the basics that appear in every language (functions, basic startup useful things, etc) and it'll be the same in (almost) every language

proyect file:
- a very small proyect doing something that its important in that language

any other files that I feel are suited to go there

README:
- When should you use it (short summary as to not read the whole README if it won't end up helping)
- Setup to execute the basic program
- Specific explanation of how to execute the basic program
- Brief explanation of what the language is mostly used for
- Brief explanation of each language's strengths
- Brief explanation of what each file does
- My experience with the language (will be changing through time)

In general, no file should be longer than 100 lines. It has to serve as a refresher for forgotten syntax and startup proyects

A lot of the explanations will be heavily inspired by ChatGPT 3.5 by OpenAI
