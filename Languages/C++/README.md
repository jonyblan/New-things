Summary:
C++ is ideal for projects demanding high performance and low-level control, such as system programming, game development with Unreal Engine, and applications with real-time processing needs. Its ability to manipulate hardware directly and deliver efficient code makes it a go-to language for performance-critical scenarios.

Setup:
- Setup: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC for Linux, MinGW for Windows, Xcode Command Line Tools for macOS).

Execution:
1) Open a text editor and paste the C++ code into a new file with a .cpp extension (e.g., program.cpp).
2) Open a terminal or command prompt.
3) Navigate to the directory containing your C++ file.
4) Compile the program by running: g++ program.cpp -o program.
5) Execute the compiled program with: ./program (on Linux/macOS) or program.exe (on Windows).

Why/how is it used:
- Systems Programming: C++ is used for developing low-level systems software, operating systems, and embedded systems.
- Game Development: Many game engines, including Unreal Engine, use C++ for game development.
- Performance-Critical Applications: C++ is known for its performance, making it suitable for performance-critical applications like graphics processing.

Strengths:
- Low-Level Control: C++ allows low-level memory manipulation and provides direct control over hardware, making it suitable for system-level programming.
- Performance: C++ is known for its high performance, making it a preferred choice for applications where speed is critical.
